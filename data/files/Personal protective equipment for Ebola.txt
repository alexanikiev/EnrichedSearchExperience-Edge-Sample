Personal protective equipment for Ebola. Due to the urgency of the Ebola outbreak and the WHOâ€™s scale up of international response in west Africa, WHO is providing technical information on appropriate available essential medical devices which are indispensable for treatment centres, community-based units and other preventive activities, in affected and neighbouring countries. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is most important in preventing transmission of the Ebola virus not only in treatment centres but also various activities, e.g. cleaning, waste management and safe burials, and community care related to the outbreak.
