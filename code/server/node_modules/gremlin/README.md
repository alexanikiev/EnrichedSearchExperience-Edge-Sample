# JavaScript Gremlin Language Variant

[Apache TinkerPopâ„¢][tk] is a graph computing framework for both graph databases (OLTP) and graph analytic systems
(OLAP). [Gremlin][gremlin] is the graph traversal language of TinkerPop. It can be described as a functional,
data-flow language that enables users to succinctly express complex traversals on (or queries of) their application's
property graph.

Gremlin-Javascript implements Gremlin within the JavaScript language and can be used on Node.js.

```bash
npm install gremlin
```

Gremlin-Javascript is designed to connect to a "server" that is hosting a TinkerPop-enabled graph system. That "server" 
could be [Gremlin Server][gs] or a [remote Gremlin provider][rgp] that exposes protocols by which Gremlin-Javascript 
can connect.

A typical connection to a server running on "localhost" that supports the Gremlin Server protocol using websockets 
looks like this:

```javascript
const gremlin = require('gremlin');
const traversal = gremlin.process.AnonymousTraversalSource.traversal;
const DriverRemoteConnection = gremlin.driver.DriverRemoteConnection;

const g = traversal().withRemote(new DriverRemoteConnection('ws://localhost:8182/gremlin'));
```

Once "g" has been created using a connection, it is then possible to start writing Gremlin traversals to query the 
remote graph:

```javascript
g.V().hasLabel('person').values('name').toList()
  .then(names => console.log(names));

const names = await g.V().hasLabel('person').values('name').toList();
console.log(names);
```

Please see the [reference documentation][docs] at Apache TinkerPop for more information.

NOTE that versions suffixed with "-rc" are considered release candidates (i.e. pre-alpha, alpha, beta, etc.) and 
thus for early testing purposes only.
